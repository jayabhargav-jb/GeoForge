## Description
Utilizing a UAV or a ground vehicle to map an environment using LIDAR, and convert it to a 3D STL model.

## Approach
Using ROS, this project will control a quadcopter in a simulated environment on gazebo, and get a LIDAR scan using the /scan rostopic. This LIDAR scan will be converted into an STL model, and verify it.
